PyQt Note
=========

Bitnomon can use either PySide or PyQt as its Qt binding. PyQt is recommended,
because there is a memory leak at least as of PySide 1.2.1.

PySide, like Qt itself, is available under the LGPL. PyQt is only available
under the GPL or a commercial license from Riverbank Computing Limited. If you
use or distribute Bitnomon with PyQt, you may be subject to the additional
restrictions of the GPL.
